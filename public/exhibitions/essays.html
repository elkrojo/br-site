                <h1>SIN CORNER</h1>
              </div>
              <p>
                With Sin Corner, Ben Reilly populates the calm neo-classical
                interior of Triskel’s Christchurch with its flipside – a
                collection of darkly surreal objects that thumb their noses at
                the decorous rationality of the architecture. Among the serried
                pews and columns swim shoals of inky black rockets, funerary
                barques filled with gummy pink dental plastic, skeletal
                fragments bound together and partially gilded. At first, these
                uncanny, bituminous works appear to have bubbled up from the
                crypt below but Reilly has a way with material that confounds
                initial impressions.
              </p>
              <p>
                A self-described magpie, he collects, casts and recombines
                objects that are ‘shiny’ to him,and are drawn from various
                historical moments, ranging from dusty Victorian to 1950s
                kitsch. These objects are often symbolically potent; blimps,
                skulls and guns, but although they appear at first glance to be
                weighty and metallic, they are in fact made from densely
                pigmented wax. Light, malleable and buoyant, wax can trap and fx
                every surface impression, every nuance of texture, fold, pleat
                and scratch. Rather than mordant memento-mori the resulting
                works speak of a fascination with the way in which the character
                of a familiar, or loaded object can be changed utterly when
                re-made in a different substance.
              </p>
              <p>
                The school of suspended bombs and zeppelins are cartoon-like and
                defused, their tarry surface puckered and dimpled, snagging the
                eye, making one aware of their materiality. The Enfeld rifle
                recast in soft wax is oddly deadened or neutralised, its ersatz
                nature revealed by the seams and traces of its mold, it becomes
                instead an elegant aggregate of cylinders. Likewise, Tank’s
                spindly, budding form contrasts the mineral surface of its
                fattened skull with the intricate whorls and webbing of a fully
                fleshed hand, its minute transcription of surface allowing us to
                study the richly various material facts of corporeality,
                demystifying the base similarities of our bodily existence.
              </p>
              <p>
                Undercutting the darkness of his work – literal darkness, as
                much of the pieces are rendered in dense, light absorbing black
                – is an irreverent, subversive humour, as evidenced by the
                bulbous red clown-nose fixed to Man’s pale and gaping death
                mask, or Tank’s rubbery bondage costume. Similarly, a gleeful
                absurdity percolates through the melancholy of works such as
                Familiars, which could be a collection of some stranger’s
                intimate affects, including a truncated fish head and a
                strangely etiolated dog, head obscured by a cone but for the tip
                of his muzzle. This merry ambiguity brings to mind Russian
                writer Mikhail Bakhtin’s idea of the seditious power of the
                carnival where laughter and excess push aside the seriousness
                and hierarchies of ‘offcial’ life.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reilly’s distinctive sensibility, his hybrid conflations of
                contradictory elements resonate with subversive wit and are made
                even more acute in this decorous setting, studded with memorials
                to Cork’s great and good citizens.

                <h1>OLD AND WEARY</h1>
              </div>
              <p>
                The slow cancellation of the future has been accompanied by a
                deflation of expectation, Mark Fisher, Ghosts of the My Life.
              </p>
              <p>
                A few weeks ago I wrote a column that made reference to a
                theorist who died tragically in January and an artwork that was
                given to me as a present from a colleague and friend. The
                theorist is Mark Fisher and my attraction to his writings comes
                from his ongoing emphasis on a weariness that we’re living
                through culturally. Fisher wrote with much passion about the
                lack of the new that pervades contemporary Western culture; in
                its preoccupation with retro, with the already done, and focused
                on a weariness that seems endemic to our current cultural
                constellation: a consequence of what he famously called the
                ‘slow cancellation of the future.’
              </p>
              <p>
                I return from walking the grounds of Glenstal Abbey, near where
                I live, and I start a fire in my sitting room. The phone rings
                and it’s the artist ‘Ben Reilly.’ We talk about the column I’d
                written and other pieces and he wonders whether I’d be
                interested in writing about his upcoming show. I’m weary, tired,
                and a little short of inspiration. But later I begin thinking
                about Ben’s use of materials that seem genuinely old in his
                sculptures, as in curiously old, and his preoccupation with
                weary figures, that seems all too aware of the weariness Fisher
                is – in his writing – trying to combat. Ben is working against
                the impulse to zoom in on the past as if it is something we can
                just dip into at will. Instead, he wants us to think about the
                old, not as a condition of what can be done again, the reworking
                of an influence that comes from the past, but as an ambience, a
                feel; that of a world not ours yet there still: within touching
                distance.
              </p>
              <p>
                The world stepped into when we explore Ben’s work is made up of
                things, materials, objects, stuff. Is it a door handle? A
                leather boot? A bag of materials that looks like but isn’t quite
                coal? Does it matter? These are old things. But the sense of the
                old is that of time as something pure. Unlike the reworking of
                the past we find in so much popular culture, this is a sensuous
                oldness; we want to touch and explore. We want to feel the
                object of time itself. The installation Zeppelin is one example.
                The title refers to the object of the zeppelin itself with all
                its historical associations. But when engaging the sculpture, we
                are drawn to its clunky feel, its use of essentially old
                materials, bringing us back to that sensuous oldness that is not
                the past but time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another example is Bladderhead, a head cast of a weary, beaten
                down man; his eyes shut as if turning away from the sparkling
                newness of a world that confronts him at every turn. Perhaps
                this man is defeated by the glittering objects that surround
                him; the weariness he feels because of this. This weary figure
                pervades Ben’s practice across media. It feels as if he’s
                shutting his eyes in the hope that he can retreat into a world
                where the old is not the past but the shimmer of time itself. I
                wonder if this man is Ben, weary with this world and therefore
                making another. Or maybe he represents a part of me that wants
                to tune out of the present, if only for a moment. But then a
                light bulb goes off and I think that Bladderhead is in fact us
                all, cast in that cultural constellation Fisher writes about as
                so obsessed with recycling the past, and therefore looking to
                retreat into a world both sensuous and old: the feeling of time
                itself.

                Breath: 2016 filmed in Berlin and Cork.<br />
                Super Eight Black and White Digital Film with Sound Work by
                Giordai Ua Laoghaire.<br />

              <p>
                Breath started out as a reference to a picture postcard showing
                a photograph of a Zeppelin flying over the Brandenburg gate in
                1905. I was struck by how futuristic looking the image was and
                how it must have seemed to the viewer at the time. This take on
                the postcard was my initial start.
              </p>
              <p>
                Using the ruins of Kaiser Wilhelm memorial Church in Berlin for
                the skyline and splicing that with a film of a piece of Steel
                Sculpture that I made to look slightly Zeppelin like, filmed in
                Cork. While filming the skyline In Berlin I became interested in
                the clouds and the idea for the sound on the film came out of
                this observation and the thought of what sound a cloud would
                make if it was possible to hear, and the sound for Breath was
                developed with that question. The cloud is air going through
                different currents and temperatures is still made up of Air and
                so the idea of one breath was the continuous breath of the
                cloud.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through sound recording techniques my one breath was stretched
                and pushed through a grill like process (granular synthesis) and
                those stretches thrown back on itself so that if the sound
                pattern was a visible shape it would resemble a cigar or
                Zeppelin like form, so one continuous breath never ending.

                <h1>DUST</h1>
              </div>
              <p>
                The Piece that became Dust started in early 2016 when casting
                envelopes and milk cartons in wax. Then while on a residency in
                Berlin in august 2016 I began casting fist sized cobble stones,
                that were used as footpaths and could often be found loose on
                the streets; enabling their other use as missiles in countless
                street riots / protests throughout History.
              </p>
              <p>
                I combined the cobblestones with casts of paper bags also found
                in Berlin; like an American grocery bag.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rectangular in shape and ranging from the larger bags at 50 x 25
                x 15 cm to smaller ones at 25 x 15 x 10 cm.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of the larger bags I attached a cast of a particulate
                hinged and handled piece of wood, perhaps like a jerry can or an
                ammunition box but dented and very impractical.
              </p>
              <p>
                The stones and bags were cast with wax mixed with Ground soot
                and black pigment. There is something about the weight of the
                stones in the different size bags that give each one an
                individual presence and together these objects make up a
                landscape that I used in different configurations depending on
                the venues.

              </div>
              <p>
                Ben Reilly’s studio is an onslaught of memory. Bodiless heads,
                amputated stumps of things that once lived, maybe, reside
                alongside remnants of weaponry, begging to speak from the past.
                The whole suggests, to my mind, the aftermath of catastrophe. My
                initial reaction was to go back to W. G. Sebald’s Air War and
                Literature to affirm the relationship I immediately formed
                between the studio and Sebald’s attempt to work out the
                repression of Germany’s memorialising after the Allied bombings
                of the country during World War II. Sebald dwelt on the charred
                natural and manmade scapes, the remnants of terrain shaped by
                human life, the remnants of human bodies, present but past. Like
                Sebald’s gathering of memory fragments in words and photographs,
                Reilly gathers them in drawings, prints, photographs and most of
                all, sculpture. His studio is a sophisticated space, a memory
                bank where memory emanates not from death, specifically, but
                from some deep-rooted fascination with manmade detritus, of
                things touched, shaped, destroyed and remade by human
                intervention. They are, as Aleida Assmann put it, ‘agents of
                haunting’.
              </p>
              <p>
                This mnemonic character, seen most recently in works such as
                Islands (GlogauAIR, Berlin, 2017) continues in Graft. The seed
                of Graft, made of wax dyed near-black, took physical shape by
                making a number of casts of a trumpet bell which placed bell-end
                down, initially resembled for the artist a thicket of sorts.
                Elements of the trumpet have found their way into Graft, where
                its sensuously smooth tubular form is married to delicate,
                brittle, tree-like bodies whose surfaces alternate between
                deeply pitted ravage and subtly gleaming smoothness that demands
                touch. With fascination, I watched as the artist hatched one of
                Graft’s components from its mould, carefully cutting through the
                cocoon of plaster and shiny pink latex. Closer inspection
                revealed textures of tree bark mingled with striated scars – but
                moulded rather than inflicted. Graft references a tree
                photographed by Reilly in Sougia, Crete, a former Roman site
                near where Allied soldiers were taken prisoner after German
                paratroopers overran the island during World War II. That the
                tree indicates a site of Axis destruction and Cretan resistance
                invoked the special significance of trees in former war zones as
                carriers of memory – numerous trees on the Gallipoli peninsula
                have been planted from the solitary Turkish pine that marked the
                site of the Battle of Lone Pine in 1915, and amputated trees
                symbolised the human toll in Paul Nash’s paintings of the World
                War I battlefield. The use of the trumpet is not merely playful,
                either. The artist recalled hearing the plaintive beauty of
                sounds played from damaged wind instruments found on
                centuries-old battlefields. Together, the elements of Graft
                become sentinels of the past, at once playful and mournful, an
                uneasy site of memory.

                This is but one reading. Graft, part of the artist’s ongoing
                interrogation, is open and organic, even humorous in meaning.
                Resistant to easy interpretation, the power of Ben Reilly’s work
                is the artist’s deep awareness and sensitivity to objects, the
                individual relationships formed with them and the myriad
                connotations stirred by them. A self-confessed magpie, he is
                fascinated by surface, texture and form and, it would seem a
                primary concern, how objects and people, and our relationship to
                them, are affected by time.

                Sometimes, silence is smarter than the urge to pin meanings onto
                art.
